The food is okay and the portions are large, but the prices are somewhat steep for this part of town. They have a lot of parking space and a lot of sitting room, so there's usually no need to reserve a table. A selection of lunch menus is served daily, but they also have a large a la carte menu if nothing strikes your fancy.",

Very creamy with strong truffles flavour, the pasta was cooked just right. The secondi was fried calamari with fries. Nothing to shout about but portion was big. The dessert was crepes with Nutella filling.\n\nSpecial mention about their house white. At Euros 1.50 per glass, it is really value for money. Not fantastic wine but at this price point……",

We had two chicken dishes (curry & vegetables with almonds) with rice. Both were  alright, just not strong in flavor. Besides, we enjoyed a sweet-sour soup with was good. Lastly, the yasmin tea was tasty as well. The location is central, with parking possibilities. The interior design is unique with Chinese characteristics. The price for tea and soup was alright. However, the chicken/rice dishes in my opinion a bit too expensive.\nAt the end we were served a plum apperative and a good luck cookie, each. Very kind!!!\nOverall, interesting place to have lunch at.",

Ajda burger is a great option, located in the neighborhood of BTC, this option is always great if you are hungry and want a great money-value meal. Open until late night including Saturdays and Sundays which is appreciated.\nI very often come with my wife here as I enjoy Ajda burger and always there is a salad or grill vegetable option for her.\nThe staff always friendly and listening to customers… highly recommended!",

The eggplant on hot plate (jajčevec na vroči plošči) is exceptional, had it 3 times so far, and couldn't believe the taste each time. I normally dislike eggplants but I urge everyone to try this.\nThere is an option to have it with meat, I always order the veg-only version.\nSome of the other dishes we tried were young peas in a pod, tofu in gong bao wok and sichuan tofu. All were great, but nothing beats the eggplants. The portions are big, so we usually order 1 dish per 2 persons.\nMy friends had a bunch of sushi and really liked it.",

What we liked is that they are creative with flavours and not all food tastes the same  which might be the case in some chinese restaurants. They have good noodles with shrimps, shrimos in tempura, rice gnocchi with egg and chicken and shrimps on a hot plate. Sushi looked good as well, but we did not try it yet as it is very hard to get a good sushi in Slovenia. They could improve in the dessert section. Desserts are ok, but as they are very good at other dishes, they could be as well at the last sweet part. Perhaps they could add some more Japan sweets as they have also Japan kitchen, such as Japanese cheesecake, Matcha Swiss roll, Dorayaki, chocolate Chiffon cake, Purin and much more. Overall we were all very satisfied with the food and will return for sure. I highly reccomend this restaurant.",

The interior of the place and how the waiters are dressed give you the feeling you are at a high-end place. The location, however, is not glamorous at all. The restaurant is located in between the mall, supermarkets and outlets, and across a Subways. If it would have been located in Ljubljana city center, then it would have been a hit, but now it felt a bit odd as a dinner place. For lunch time, it would probably be a nice/better option as the area will then be more lively.",

Typically, I don't opt for breakfast, but this experience was a delightful exception. The quality of food here stands out in comparison to many other hotels I've stayed at. During my week-long stay, I had the opportunity to try almost everything they offered. The salads were fresh, with a variety of sauces, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Yogurts and toppings were available. The hot foods, including scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, and roasted vegetables, were delicious. They also provided an impressive selection of cheeses, salamis, and the like. The dumplings were average, but everything else was nearly perfect. I would consider staying at this hotel again, if only for the breakfast.\n\nService was satisfying, too.",

Another thing I am not a fan of are the dirty toilets. Inappropriate for a place with such good food and high prices.\nAnother issue is that they offer cow's milk. They're supposed to be a vegan place, so be careful when you order a cappuccino, it could come with animal secretions. The cow's milk coffee is actually cheaper than the plant version, they serve it as a deafult. Apparently money > values.",

Barbarella has a really good selection of food and drinks - pizzas,  salad, bowls, smoothies, deserts. All is highly esthetic, portions are big, but I was not impressed much by the taste.

This restaurant, which specializes in Argentina beef, not only delivered on its promise but also surprised me with exceptional wines and mouthwatering pizza.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped into the restaurant, the ambiance set the stage for an extraordinary dining experience. The warm and inviting décor, combined with the aroma of sizzling meats, instantly piqued my appetite. As a lover of steak, I was eager to indulge in the renowned Argentina beef that the restaurant is famous for.\n\nThe beef dishes that graced my table were nothing short of spectacular. Cooked to perfection, each bite was a symphony of tenderness and flavor, a testament to the quality of the ingredients and the mastery of the chefs. The rich, robust flavors of Argentina beef shone through, leaving an unforgettable impression on my taste buds.\n\nWhile the restaurant's specialty was undoubtedly the beef, the surprises didn't end there. The exceptional selection of wines further elevated the dining experience. The staff's knowledge and passion for wine pairings were evident as they guided me through the options, ensuring that each sip perfectly complemented the dishes.\n\nA delightful surprise awaited me in the form of the restaurant's pizza offerings. The pizza, often overshadowed in a beef-focused establishment, was a revelation. The thin, crispy crust provided the perfect canvas for a medley of fresh toppings, resulting in a pizza that rivaled the best pizzerias in town.\n\nThe attentive service was the icing on the cake, with the staff striking the right balance between professionalism and friendliness. Their dedication to providing a memorable experience was evident in every interaction, enhancing the overall enjoyment of the meal.\n\nIn conclusion, the Argentina restaurant in Ljubljana's shopping district is a culinary treasure trove that seamlessly blends the flavors of Argentina with a local touch. From the exceptional beef dishes that are a carnivore's dream to the surprising excellence of the pizza and the impressive wine selection, this restaurant delivers a feast for the senses. Whether you're a meat enthusiast or simply seeking a dining experience that stands out, this establishment is a must-visit.",
